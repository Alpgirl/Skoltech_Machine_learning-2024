# Skoltech Machine Learning Course Project 2024

Welcome to our Machine Learning course project repository! This project is part of the 2024 curriculum at Skoltech, aimed at exploring innovative solutions and advancing the field of machine learning.

## Project Overview

This project is focused on creating an advanced approach for the accurate segmentation and classification of brain tumors, utilizing a dataset called “Brain MRI segmentation” for segmentation task and then train classification on  "Brain Tumor Classification" dataset that are filled with magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain. Our goal is to accurately segment and classify various types of tumors through the application of various deep learning models, including CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), U-Net, ResNet, and others. This endeavor seeks to leverage the capabilities of these models to improve the precision and efficiency of brain tumor diagnosis.
